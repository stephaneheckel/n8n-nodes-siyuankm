# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **New `Database` resource** — real SiYuan AttributeView CRUD via `/api/av/*`. Operations: List, Create, Get, Get Schema, Add Row, Remove Row, Add Column, Remove Column, Set Cell. Supports text, number, date, select, multi-select, checkbox, url, email, and phone column types. Closes #2.
- **New `Markdown Table` resource** — refactored from PR #3 (thanks @chaimt). Plain Markdown table CRUD (parses pipe-delimited rows): Create, Get, Add Row, Update Row, Delete Row. Parsing logic moved to `lib/markdownTable.ts`.

### Fixed
- **Document > Get Document Path by ID** and **Get Document ID by Path** now return a well-formed object (`{ id, path, found }` / `{ notebookId, path, ids, count, found, id }`) instead of a raw string / string array. n8n's Schema and Table tabs now render correctly, and downstream IF nodes no longer abort when a document is not found. Also wrapped `Get Storage Path`, `Get Readable Path from Storage Path`, and `Get Content`. Closes #6.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-10

### Breaking Changes
- Node version bumped to v2 — the main SiYuan node now uses a **Resource + Operation** pattern instead of a flat operation dropdown.
- Existing workflows using v0.x will need to update their SiYuan node configuration to select a Resource first, then an Operation.
- "List Files in Directory" moved from System resource to Asset resource.
- Removed ExampleNode and HttpBin scaffolding nodes.

### Added
- **Resource-based architecture** — operations organized under 8 resources: Notebook, Document, Block, Attribute, Tag, Search, Asset, System.
- **20+ new operations:**
  - Notebook: Open, Close, Get Configuration, Set Configuration
  - Document: Get Storage Path, Get Readable Path from Storage Path, Get Content (AI-optimized), Get Document Tree
  - Block: Move, Fold, Unfold, Transfer References, Get Content as Markdown
  - Tag (new resource): Add, Remove, Get Tags, List All, Rename, Find Blocks by Tag
  - Search: Full-Text Search, Search by Attribute, Get Recent Changes
  - Asset (new resource): Upload Asset, Get File, Put File, Remove File, Rename File
  - System: Get Current Time, Export Resources
- **4 AI Tool nodes** for use with n8n AI agents:
  - SiYuan Document Tool
  - SiYuan Block Tool
  - SiYuan Search Tool
  - SiYuan Notebook Tool
- **SiYuan Trigger node** — polling-based trigger for document/block changes with notebook filtering.
- **Credential test** — "Test Connection" button verifies API URL and token on save.
- **Structured error handling** — errors include operation context and actionable suggestions for both humans and AI agents.
- **`usableAsTool: true`** on main node for AI agent compatibility.
- **Input validation utilities** — `validateRequiredString`, `validateSiYuanId`, `validatePath`.

### Changed
- Complete codebase restructure: split from single 734-line node file into modular resource-based architecture.
- `SiYuanClient` refactored with full TypeScript typing (no `any` types), JSDoc comments, and 30s request timeout.
- All block operations default to Markdown with DOM available as an advanced option.
- Error messages now include remediation suggestions.
- Updated dependencies: axios 1.15.0, prettier 3.8.2, eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base 1.16.6.
- Added `form-data` dependency for multipart asset uploads.
- Added `@types/node` for Buffer type support.

### Removed
- ExampleNode and HttpBin scaffolding from n8n starter template.
- README_TEMPLATE.md.
- ExampleCredentialsApi and HttpBinApi credential files.
